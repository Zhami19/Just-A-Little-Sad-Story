<h1>Just a little sad story... 
<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª The Nostalgic Repository:</h2>

  For my 18th birthday in 2022, I got my Acer laptop because I wanted to play video games and be able to draw and 3D model without any crashes.  
  
  I was not tech savvy at all, and never in a million years did I think I would get into programming.  I was so tech-illiterate that I actually
  stored all my documents in the downloads folder instead of the documents folder... do you know where this is going?

  Fastforward two years and I am in game design and programming classes and have finished a few projects I am proud of, however, I am still a noob
  and... still did not notice that the path of most of my documents started with the, yes, the downloads folder (aha, that's right).  One day, I want to download
  Call of Duty Black Ops III on my laptop, but realize I don't have enough space.  I go to my storage settings, and... yes, I delete everything in
  my downloads folder to make space for Call of Duty.  I happily play Call of Duty with my friend until late at night :)

  Next morning, I'm crying because I lost all of my artwork and Unity projects.  Thankfully, my artwork was backed up in Dropbox (and now in a Pen Drive, too),
  but my Unity projects were lost (except for My Flappy Bird Game, which for some miraculous miracle I did not store in my downloads folder and it is available
  for you to see in my other repository).  Ever since, I understood the importance of repositories!

  I just wanted to share my story of how I came to use Github.  I hope you enjoyed.

  Here are some screenrecordings of projects I lost (one of them I published on Itch.io before I lost it, so you can even play it :D):
  
- <b>The Thief</b>

  This was a project for my Introduction to Game Development and Design class. We had a week to make the game; all the assets were drawn by me.
  I made this game in Unity and programmed it in C#. This project further expanded my ability to program different mechanics (walking, jumping,
  mouse dexterity, switches, a counter, etc.), as well as briefly introduced me to the art of animation.

- <b>The Maze</b>

  This was a project for my Introduction to Game Development and Design class. We had a week to make the game; all the assets were imported from Kenney asset store.
  In this project I learned about tile mapping and programming a mechanic where the player rotates the camera (in C#).

- <b>The Escape</b>

   This was a project for my Introduction to Game Development and Design class. We had a week to make the game; all the assets were drawn by me.
   I made this project in Unity and programmed it in C#. I learned to program mechanics such as moving obstacles, double jumping, and dashing.
 
  AH, I remembered I also lost an Unreal Engine project for my Leven Design class:

- <b>IKEA Project</b>

  I learned lots about environmental sotrytelling with that one...
  
  At the time, I was also working on the Zelda Dungeon that can be seen in my other repository.  I lost the whitebox I had made, and had to start from scratch, haha!
  What a horrible day.

  Anyway, at the time it seemed like the end of the world, but now all I can do is laugh (I learned a good lesson from it, and none of them were huge, professional projects).
   At the time I am writing this, I am planning to start taking programming a bit more seriously, so I'll be making more and more repositories soon.

  Bye bye.
